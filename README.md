# Jira Time Logger (jiratimelogger)

A simple GUI utility that makes it very easy for a user to log time against his/her tasks in Jira. 

# Need for this utility

- An agile team member needs to perform upto 5-6 UI actions (login to Jira, go to the board, select a story, go to the task, select Log Time, Enter time,...) to update hours spent against a Sub-Task in Jira.
- Time logged is more a guesstimate, and is not accurate.
- Team's velocity metrics are not accurate because of the guesstimate Log Times.

# What does this utility do?

- Shows the user a list of Sub-Tasks as per the default/custom Jira Query filter.
- Facilitates the user to log accurate time in Jira with just a single click.
- Relieves the user from doing all the Math and guess work to log time in Jira.
- User doesn't need to worry about session timeouts and re-logins.
